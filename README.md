If you didn't read the about section of this repository, I don't judge you. Really.
This is just a massive glorified dump for stuff I learned in the last few months
I started learning programming just this year and have about 4 months of learning experiences
and my proudest achievement was making a program that put 'deez' and 'nuts' together

I am very funny (i'm not)
